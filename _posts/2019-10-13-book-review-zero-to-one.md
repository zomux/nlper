### TL;DR Book Review

Key Message: 

To successfully run a startup, the founders have to consider seven factors: 1) significant tech breakthrough 2) timing 3) monopoly in small markets 4) right management team 5) effective distribution of products 6) durability of continuous monopoly 7) uniqueness.

### Main Points

**Seven keys**

- Tech breakthrough
	- Customers don't buy incremental improvements
	- Make sure you get 10X improvement
- Timing
	- Choose the right time to join the competition
	- Last mover advantage: the last development to productize the tech is more important than the first development
- Monopoly
	- Gain monopoly in small markets with big share is important for high profit
	- Facebook started as a social website in Stanford
- Right management team
	- Choosing founders are like marrying people
	- Balanced ownership, position and control
	- Question who owns the company, who runs it, who governs it
- Distribution
	- Think how to sell to customers and employees
- Durability
	- How the business can grow and endure, generating long-term cash flow
	- Companies are valued by future cash flow
- Uniqueness
	- Don't just another internet company in dot com bubble

**Thoughts on competition**

- Competition drives down the growth and profit space
- So, better to build monopoly in a small market
	- With much better tech
	- With network effects
	- Then scale it
	- Then do some branding


**Thoughts on lean startups**

- Lean startup is a methodology that takes you to a local optimum
- However, the power law focuses on exponential growth
- Plan the blueprint of growth. Company sell shares and merge because they don't know what to do.

**How to recruit people**

- Make sure people commit full-time
- Stock option is better than cash
- Either on bus of off the bus
- Great people join because of the *mission* and *team* (not cash and stocks)

**How to build the board**

- A board of three is health for private companies


**Thoughts on clean tech bubble**

- They failed to answer the seven key questions
- Tesla wins as it has the monopoly
