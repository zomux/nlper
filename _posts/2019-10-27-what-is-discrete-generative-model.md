title: What is a discrete generative model and how to learn it

### Discriminative model

First, may be we are more familiar with a discriminative model, or we usually call it a classification model. Here are some examples of classification models:

| Input  | Output (label) |
|--|--|
| Image  | Whether it's a animal (1 or 0)  |
| Email | Whether it's a spam (1 or 0) |
| A sentence | Next word in the sentence (a word) |
| Voice record | Text (word sequence) |

In machine learning, a discriminative model does not directly give the label, but the probability of the label.
