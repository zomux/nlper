### Discriminative model

First, may be we are more familiar with a discriminative model, or we usually call it a classification model. Here are some examples of classification models:

| Input  | Output (label) |
|--|--|
| Image  | Whether it's a animal (1 or 0)  |
| Email | Whether it's a spam (1 or 0) |
|
