Introducing MemU — An Intelligent Memory Layer for AI Companions

Current AI memory solutions face scalability challenges. They rely on explicit modeling — manually telling the system which memories matter and which don’t. This approach fundamentally limits the AI’s ability to truly understand what’s important to you and memorize what matters most.

Moreover, existing solutions take a one-fits-all approach, applying the same memory mechanisms across all use cases. We’re taking a different path by specializing in AI companion scenarios, optimizing every aspect of memory specifically for meaningful, long-term relationships between humans and AI.

That’s where [MemU](https://github.com/NevaMind-AI/memU) comes in.

MemU provides an intelligent memory layer for AI agents, purpose-built for AI companions. It treats memory as a hierarchical file system—one where entries can be written, connected, revised, and prioritized automatically over time.

At the core of MemU is a dedicated memory agent. It receives conversational input, documents, user behaviors, and multimodal context, then converts them into structured memory files and updates existing ones. The result is a system that remembers what truly matters and improves with use.

More details about MemU can be found in the [Github Page](https://github.com/NevaMind-AI/memU).
