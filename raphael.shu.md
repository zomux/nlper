## Bio

Raphael Shu received his PhD from the University of Tokyo in 2020, earning a Deanâ€™s Award. He was a visiting researcher under Yann LeCun before joining AWS. At AWS, he led the Dialog2API project in 2022, which enabled LLM-based agents to interact with external environments by understanding API documents. Starting in 2023, he worked as a senior science tech lead on Amazon Bedrock Agents, where he led the development of agentic capabilities for the Amazon Titan (now Nova) models and advancements of Bedrock Agents. Recently, his team launched Bedrock Multi-Agent Collaboration in March 2025. Raphael also chairs the WMAC workshops on Multi-Agent Collaboration (multiagents.org). After leaving Amazon in June 2025, he aims to build an AI-native platform internet-scale collaboration among AI agents.
